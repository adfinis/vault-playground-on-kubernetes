  source:
    # Source 'uri' supports the following protocols: Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP,
    # and all URL and archive formats as described in https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter
    # In 'uri', Golang templates are supported  https://pkg.go.dev/text/template

    # Only include the files that match the 'included_paths' patterns
    # If 'included_paths' is not specified, all files will be matched except those that match the patterns from 'excluded_paths'

    # Note that we are excluding 'context.tf' since a newer version of it will be downloaded using 'mixins'
    # 'excluded_paths' support POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star `**` is supported)
    excluded_paths:
      - "**/context.tf"

  # mixins override files from 'source' with the same 'filename' (e.g. 'context.tf' will override 'context.tf' from the 'source')
  # mixins are processed in the order they are declared in the list
